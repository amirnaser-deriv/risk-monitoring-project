# Real-Time Risk Monitoring System: Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the Real-Time Risk Monitoring System, a comprehensive solution designed to provide immediate insights into our trading positions, exposures, and associated risks related to gold and silver, including their derived indices. This system empowers proactive risk management and informed decision-making.

## Business Overview (Page 1)

The Real-Time Risk Monitoring System is a critical tool for managing our exposure to gold and silver markets. It consists of two primary interfaces:

1.  **Trading Site:** This platform allows our traders to execute trades on gold, silver, and related indices (Gold RSI Momentum, Gold RSI Contrarian, Silver RSI Momentum, Silver RSI Contrarian). The platform provides real-time price updates and immediate feedback on order execution.

2.  **Risk Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a comprehensive, real-time view of our overall risk profile. It displays key metrics such as total positions, gold and silver exposure, daily profit and loss (P&L), and an overall risk level (Low, Medium, High). Interactive charts visualize position distribution, risk exposure, P&L trends, and trading volume. The dashboard also generates alerts for critical events, such as high exposure levels, significant losses, or excessive position concentration.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Real-time Visibility:** Continuous monitoring of market positions and risk metrics.
*   **Proactive Risk Management:** Early warning system for potential risks.
*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Data-driven insights to support strategic trading decisions.
*   **Improved Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined trading and risk management processes.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Role-based access control and secure data handling.

**System Functionality (High-Level):**

The system simulates trading activity and market fluctuations. The core logic resides in a Python-based "feed engine" that updates prices and calculates derived indices (RSI Momentum and Contrarian) for both gold and silver. These indices represent different trading strategies. The trading site allows simulated trades on these indices, and the risk dashboard aggregates this data to present a consolidated view of our risk exposure.
